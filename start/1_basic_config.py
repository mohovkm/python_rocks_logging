# About:  Configuring logger with basicConfig, difference between logging and logger.
#         Loggers should NEVER be instantiated directly, but always through the module-level function:
#         logging.getLogger(name)
# Docs:   https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig
#         https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logger-objects
# Output: Different logger name, same format.
